## Multi-Factor Regression Summary (2025)

A Ridge regression model was applied to explain monthly NIFTY 50 returns
using India VIX and USD/INR exchange rate as explanatory factors.

### Key Findings
- India VIX shows a negative relationship with returns, confirming that
  elevated volatility periods are associated with weaker equity performance.
- USD/INR captures macroeconomic and foreign capital flow dynamics influencing
  index returns.
- The model provides an additive attribution of returns to individual factors.

### Limitations
- Linear structure does not capture regime shifts.
- Additional macro variables could improve explanatory power.
