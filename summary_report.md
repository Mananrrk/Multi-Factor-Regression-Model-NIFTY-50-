## Summary of Multi-Factor Regression (2025)

The India VIX and the USD/INR exchange rate were used as explanatory factors in a Ridge regression model to explain monthly NIFTY 50 returns.

### Key Findings: 
The India VIX exhibits a negative correlation with returns, indicating that periods of high volatility are linked to poorer equity performance.
The macroeconomic and foreign capital flow dynamics that affect index returns are captured by the USD/INR exchange rate.
An additive attribution of returns to individual factors is provided by the model.

### Restrictions/Limitations: 
Regime shifts are not captured by linear structures.
The explanatory power could be increased by including more macro variables.zations.
